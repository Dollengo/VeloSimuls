Here's a comprehensive `README.md`, `unixbuild.sh`, `mingwbuild.sh`, and `requisites.md` for your C++ game project.

# VeloSimul

**VeloSimul** is a simple C++ game that simulates a player's movement on a 10x10 grid. The player can move up, down, left, or right using a menu-driven interface. The game demonstrates basic grid manipulation and player movement with velocity.

## Features

- A 10x10 grid where the player is represented by the character 'P'.
- User input-driven movement (up, down, left, right) and exit options.
- Simple physics simulation with player velocity.

## Compilation and Build

The project includes scripts for building on Unix-based systems and Windows (using MinGW). Choose the appropriate script based on your operating system.

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, for more advanced build systems)

### Build on Unix-Based Systems

1. Ensure you have `g++` or `clang++` installed.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:

    ```sh
    ./unixbuild.sh
    ```

### Build on Windows with MinGW

1. Ensure you have MinGW installed.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:

    ```sh
    ./mingwbuild.sh
    ```

### Running the Game

After building the project, you can run the executable `VeloSimul`:

```sh
./VeloSimul
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to set the player's initial velocity and position, and use the menu options to move the player.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main game logic, including grid initialization, display, and user interaction.
- `player.cpp`: Implements the `Player` class, including movement and position handling.
- `player.hpp`: Header file for the `Player` class, defining its interface.
